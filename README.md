Personal home automation

I started to work with Home Assistant for fun, but as my home system has evolved and the difficulty has increased
it has become an addicting hobby.
I have spent one hour per day on average working with my automation system.
It is very simple, built mostly with cheap Chinese components. Below is the list of them, where I bought them, how much I paid and what functions they perform.
